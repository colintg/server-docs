= Fail over to the DR cluster
//:page-aliases: tigergraph-server:crr:fail-over.adoc

In the event of catastrophic failure that has impacted the full cluster due to Data Center or Region failure, the user can initiate the failover to the Disaster Recovery (DR) cluster.
This is a manual process.

Run the following commands to make configuration changes on the DR cluster to upgrade it to the primary cluster.

[source,console]
----
gadmin config set System.CrossRegionReplication.Enabled false
gadmin config apply -y
gadmin restart -y
----

== Set up a new DR cluster after failover

After you fail over to your DR cluster, your DR cluster is now the primary cluster. You may want to set up a new DR cluster to still be able to recover your services in the event of another disaster.

To set up a new DR cluster over the upgraded primary cluster:

. Make a backup of the upgraded primary cluster
. Run the following command on the new cluster. The commands are the mostly same as setting up the first DR cluster, except that in the fourth command, the value for `System.CrossRegionReplication.TopicPrefix` becomes `Primary.Primary` instead of `Primary`
. On the new DR cluster, restore from the backup of the upgraded primary cluster

[source,console]
----
# Enable Kafka Mirrormaker
$ gadmin config set System.CrossRegionReplication.Enabled true

# Kafka mirrormaker primary cluster's IPs, separator by ','
$ gadmin config set System.CrossRegionReplication.PrimaryKafkaIPs PRIMARY_IP1,PRIMARY_IP2,PRIMARY_IP3

# Kafka mirrormaker primary cluster's KafkaPort
$ gadmin config set System.CrossRegionReplication.PrimaryKafkaPort 30002

# The prefix of GPE/GUI/GSQL Kafka Topic, by default is empty.
$ gadmin config set System.CrossRegionReplication.TopicPrefix Primary.Primary

# Apply the config changes, init Kafka, and restart
$ gadmin config apply -y
$ gadmin init kafka -y
$ gadmin restart all -y
----

There is no limit on the number of times a cluster can fail over to another cluster. When designating a new DR cluster, make sure that you set the `System.CrossRegionReplication.TopicPrefix` parameter correctly by adding an additional `.Primary` .

For example, if your original cluster fails over once, and the current cluster's `TopicPrefix` is `Primary`, then the new DR cluster needs to have its `TopicPrefix` be `Primary.Primary`. If it needs to fail over again, the new DR cluster needs to have its `TopicPrefix` be set to `Primary.Primary.Primary`.
