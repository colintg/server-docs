Loading jobs which using the Kafka Loader
(from xref:data-loading:load-from-cloud.adoc[cloud storage],

or xref:data-loading:load-from-kafka.adoc[external Kafka])
make use of _data sources_, objects that you define and which become part of a graph's catalog.
Data sources are defined with a configuration file, which specify the configurations to apply to the data source.

This page describes the permissions required for different operations concerning data sources, as well as how to delete a data source.

== Data source operation permissions

A data source can be either global or local:

* A global data source can only be created by a user with `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege on the global scope, who can grant it to any graph.
* A local data source belongs to a graph and cannot be accessed by other graphs.

The following are examples of permitted `DATA_SOURCE` operations.

* Users with the `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege on the global scope may create a global level data source without assigning it to a particular graph:

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > CREATE DATA_SOURCE k1 = "/path/to/config"
----

* Users with the `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege on the global scope may grant/revoke a data source to/from one or more graphs:

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > GRANT DATA_SOURCE k1 TO GRAPH graph1, graph2
GSQL > REVOKE DATA_SOURCE k1 FROM GRAPH graph1, graph2
----

* Users with the `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege for a particular graph user may create a local data source for that graph:

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > CREATE DATA_SOURCE k1 = "/path/to/config" FOR GRAPH test_graph
----

[NOTE]
====
In the above statement, the local data_source k1 is only accessible to graph test_graph. A superuser cannot grant it to another graph.
====

== Delete a data source

A data source variable can be dropped by a user who has sufficient privileges.
A global data source can only be dropped by a users with global `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege.
Users with `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege for one graph can drop data sources on that graph.
The syntax for the `DROP DATA_SOURCE` command is as follows:

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > DROP DATA_SOURCE <source1>[<source2>...] | * | ALL
----

Below are several examples of Kafka data source `CREATE` and `DROP` commands.

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > CREATE DATA_SOURCE k1 = "/home/tigergraph/kafka.conf"
GSQL > CREATE DATA_SOURCE k2 = "/home/tigergraph/kafka2.conf"

GSQL > DROP DATA_SOURCE k1, k2
GSQL > DROP DATA_SOURCE *
GSQL > DROP DATA_SOURCE ALL
----

=== SHOW DATA_SOURCE

The `SHOW DATA_SOURCE` command will display a summary of all existing data sources for which the user has privilege:

[source.wrap,gsql]
----
GSQL > SHOW DATA_SOURCE *

// The sample output
Data Source:
  - KAFKA k1 ("127.0.0.1:9092")
The global data source will be shown in global scope. The graph scope will only show the data source it has access to.
