= Restore by Combining Backup and CDC messages

TigerGraph CDC messages and TigerGraph Backup (either Full Backup or Incremental Backup) can be combined to restore the system to a previous state.

== Steps

The steps are:

. Setup a backup.
. Restore a backup.
+
(See the documentation xref:tigergraph-server:backup-and-restore:index.adoc[] for more details.)
. Users will need to write their own script to replay TigerGraph CDC messages.

To determine whether a CDC message needs to be replayed or not. Please check for the TigerGraph backup (`gadmin backup create`), find a file metadata in the generated backup folder, such as `/tmp/backup/backup-2024-01-04T231921`:

To locate the relevant information, navigate to the JSON object `WaterMarks` for a specific instance of a GPE.

In the provided example, within the `WaterMarks` find the value associated with `LastTid`, such as `86`.

This indicates that delta records with tid equal-to-or-less-than `86`, have been processed and are included in this backup.

When dealing with CDC messages, users should focus on `tid` (found in the `mid` of each CDC message) greater-than the `LastTid` specific to the corresponding GPE partition.

Keep in mind that different GPE partitions will have distinct `LastTid` values.

In transactions, the original delta messages may be split before and after a backup within TigerGraph's internal delta queue.
However, the CDC messages generated for one transaction on a GPE partition share the same `tid` (the last COMMIT message).
Therefore, users can use the `LastTid` to ensure that a transaction is included either in the backup with a `LastTid` or in CDC messages with a `tid` larger-than the `LastTid`.

== CDC Message Examples

The examples below show how to determine whether a CDC message needs to be replayed or not by looking at the CDC message mid.

.For instance, if a user has `LastTid` values for GPE partitions 1 and 2 in the backup metadata:
[cols="2", separator=¦ ]
|===
¦ GPE Partition ¦ LastTid

¦ 1 ¦ 86
¦ 2 ¦ 47
|===

*"mid":"2|1704407469727|47|5|4"*: is a transaction CDC message from GPE Partition 2, tid 47. Thus, it is already included in the backup. The user can skip replaying it.

*"mid":"1|1704407469844|87|0"*: is a non-transaction CDC message from GPE Partition 1, tid 87. Thus,  it is not included in backup, and the user will need to replay it.
